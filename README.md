## Customizations
If you want to customize the look and feel to your preference, then navigate to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/nepali-date@biplab/` and add a `css` file. You can also edit `extension.js` file if you know what you are doing because it might break the extension if improperly configured.
It is important that after saving the changes, you logout and log back in to see the changes.

## Note
If the extension breaks or doesn't work after having your gnome version upgraded to 45, try uninstalling the old extension and re-install it again from the download link below.
